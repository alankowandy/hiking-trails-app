# Hiking Trails App

A mobile application built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android, which allows users to explore hiking trails. The app features detailed information about each trail, a stopwatch functionality for timing hikes, and the ability to share trail information via SMS. This app was built as a project for the Mobile Applications course at Politechnika Pozna≈Ñska.

## Features

- **Explore Trails**: Browse a list of hiking trails with detailed information including name, description, difficulty, and estimated time.
- **Trail Details**: View detailed information about a selected trail with images and descriptions.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for trails by name.
- **Filter Trails**: Filter trails based on difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Stopwatch**: Use the built-in stopwatch to time your hikes.
- **Share via SMS**: Share trail information with others via SMS.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout using `LazyVerticalGrid` to show more items per row on larger screens (e.g., tablets).

## External Database

This app uses an external database called Supabase to store and retrieve trail information. Please note that the database might be temporarily disabled. If you encounter any issues related to the database, please contact me and I will restore the database.
